## Tic Tac Toe

A minimal implementation as seen in reactjs' tutorial. I decided to add features like buttons that control gameplay, highlighting squares, and the option to play against an AI.

The AI player uses minimax search to find optimal moves to play at each possible board position.

## Features to add

- Offload search algorithm to web worker
- Online play/matchmaking
- Improve UI (responsiveness)

## Playing

Try it out at the Github Page linked in the repo.

## Building locally

Since, it's built with `create-react-app`

```
git clone https://github.com/stanley-xu/tic-tac-toe.git
npm start
```
